At this cultural moment, online reading spaces seem to train us to be combative in a simplistic way.

We don’t listen. Or we don’t listen deeply enough.

And worse, it often seems that we’ve been trained by the polarizing algorithms online to not even come with the expectation of learning from those whose experiences and orientations put them at odds with our current understandings..

That’s why we need to practice listening across differences.

And although we avoid controversy in the classroom, research indicates that students benefit when we help them engage in differences of opinion that employ norms of respect and mutuality.

To start, it’s important to recognize that classroom settings often avoid raising controversial issues because personal squabbles or other disciplinary issues can result. Teachers sometimes avoid opening the floor to student control for these reasons (e.g. Coker & Erwin, 2011). I know that I have, but I am more proud of the times when I have trusted myself to address challenging topics with my students. Topics that I was not sure would resolve in a single class period.

Further, this issue of controversial discussions has been explored empirically, and strong cognitive gains have been experienced over a range of studies for students who engaged in _[constructive controversy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Constructive_Controversy/daymCQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)_ (Johnson & Johnson, 2009). In this approach, students are guided to explore ideas by being trained beforehand in the norms of engagement, as follows:

> Be critical of ideas, not people. I challenge and refute the ideas of the other participants while confirming their competence and value as individuals. I do not indicate that I personally reject them.

> Separate my personal worth from criticism of my ideas.

> Remember that we are all in this together, sink or swim. I focus on coming to the best decision possible, not on winning.

> Encourage everyone to participate and to master all the relevant information.

> Listen to everyone's ideas, even if I do not agree.

> Restate what someone has said if it is not clear.

> Differentiate before I try to integrate. First, I bring out all ideas and facts supporting both sides and clarify how the positions differ. Then, I try to identify points of agreement and put them together in a way that makes sense.

> Try to understand both sides of the issue. I try to see the issue from the opposing perspective to understand the opposing position.

> Change my mind when the evidence clearly indicates that I should do so.

> Emphasize rationality in seeking the best possible answer, given the available data.

> Follow the golden rule of conflict: I act toward opponents as I would have them act toward me. I want the opposing pair to listen to me, so I listen to them. I want the opposing pair to include my ideas in their thinking, so I include their ideas in my thinking. I want the opposing pair to see the issue from my perspective, so I take their perspective (Johnson & Johnson, 2009).

The results of seven studies contained in the meta-analysis (Johnson & Johnson, 2009) showed that _constructive controversy_ interactions create much stronger effect sizes when measured against other common forms of engagement: debates, concurrence seeking, or individualistic approaches. Constructive controversy generated positive effects sizes ranging from 0.32 to 2.18across eight criteria, including key classroom indicators: achievement, cognitive reasoning,perspective taking, motivation, attitudes toward risk, interpersonal attraction, social support, and self esteem.

What this means is that students gain dramatically from controversy when it's framed constructively, and their gains are both academic and personal. The overlap between these key gains and the socio-emotional targets (e.g. CASEL.org), is striking.

The specific results of the Johnsons’ meta-analysis call attention to the notion that constructive forms of controversy can more effectively create an environment for learning when compared with concurrence-seeking approaches, with an effect size of 0.70 (n=12 studies) for achievement 0.84 (n=2 studies) for cognitive reasoning 0.97 (n=8 studies) for perspective-taking, and 0.68 (n=8 studies) for motivation. All point to the desirability of constructive controversy (Johnson & Johnson, 2009).

Disagreement can motivate participation for a range of students (Chinn, 2001). Often, however, in practice students can turn an exchange of ideas into a winner-take-all melee; thus the need for the ground rules established above. The ability to understand counter-arguments, both in range and in depth, allows a skilled argument writer to make an elaborate and effective case. Finally, the idea of teachers instilling norms (Applebee et al., 2003; Durst, 1999) prior to engaging incendiary topics is effective for guiding positive student participation (Chinn et al., 2001; Jadallah et al., 2011).

All of these research studies point to the idea that conflict, if properly framed and guided, can actually build more cohesion in the classroom and in the school. We actually come to know and understand each other more deeply and care for one another when we disagree respectfully. But how is this possible--among adults and among students?

In an asset-based classroom community, it means listening to one another and valuing the different contributions that each person is going to bring. In the Ferant School, students learn to approach difference as a source of strength. When students begin to see the strengths in each other, not only do they feel validated, but they begin to look for complementarity. The idea that we have strengths that can build off of each other because we are all so different. This is just so incredibly exciting to consider. Instead of having to fit in, we can foster a [culture of dignity](https://www.thecorecollaborative.com/post/belonging-through-dignity-provides-healing-equity-language), as Cobb and Krownapple have recently explored.

When we take the time to really listen to another--even if it leads to a bit of friendly sparring or discussion--it recognizes the expertise and insight of the other. It’s a way of paying homage to the competence of a fellow learner.

Even better is the method of Academic Controversy developed by the Johnsons, which guides students to switch roles and offer concessions that start with comments like, "I really like your point when you said…" and "I have to concede that your use of the evidence in this case made me rethink my assumptions about…" While these stems might sound a bit high-flying, if students select them from a list and have them modeled and scaffolded for them, they get good at each of them, and they love receiving these types of comments, even if they disagree with them.

It all comes back to the classroom community, how to build and speak across differences, recognizing the assets and strengths that each person brings to the conversation.
