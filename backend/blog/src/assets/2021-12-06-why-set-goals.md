If you are a classroom teacher, administrator, counselor, parent or family member of a teen or young adult, it's hard to argue against being organized and well put together. I mean, does anyone want to be a total mess? Of course not! And that's why we encourage learners–and each other–to be organized and goal directed. It's this feeling of control and self-determination that sets executive functioning (EF) apart as such a critical part of the learning process. 

EF is each learner's *superpower.* 

So much so that SEL standards outlined by [CASEL](https://casel.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/casel-wheel.png) place EF skills as the top central to their framework as they describe both self-awareness and self-management.

The problem is that schools lack a coherent plan to scale these skills up. How do we integrate these practices into all corners of a school, especially when academic concerns tend to crowd out the process skills so critical to EF. 

We settle for eating the fish instead of teaching kids how to fish.

We want them to get today's homework done instead of learning to be dynamic, organized, and poised learners for years to come.

But why do we do this? 

Simply, it's difficult to integrate. But Ferant can provide a simple on-ramp for students to gain this practice–throughout every day. 

And when learners take the time to organize, break down, coordinate, subordinate and timeline their goals and work, they actually frees up emotional bandwidth for them to enjoy life. They can rest easy and enjoy the moments of their days, knowing that they have a plan that will help them to succeed.

With Ferant, learners of all ages get a platform to not only manage their tasks but to set important goals that relate to their lived experiences both in and out of school. And they get to organize their workflow through an attractive task manager that takes only a few minutes in each academic class. With this consistent practice across classes, the disjointed assemblage of experiences that we call "school" becomes a threaded, cohesive experience called the *Ferant School*.

Research tells us that to learn executive functioning skills deeply, learners need repetition as well as practice in actual contexts. The use of Ferant across various classes helps with both of these things, and it helps students to reduce their stress and gain control over their progress. 

Students are handling the risks in their lives and doing it well. They are able to direct their vast intellectual and emotional resources to accomplish what they have deemed worthy to accomplish and will still have excess left over.

So why should we guide students to practice Executive Functioning? Here is a top ten effects of goal setting on young people: 
1. Improves self-image
2. Increases awareness of one's strengths
3. Increases awareness of one's weaknesses
4. Provides an experience of success
5. Facilitates effective visualization
6. Clarifies the path ahead
7. Encourages prioritization
8. Defines reality and separating it from wishful thinking
9. Builds responsibility for one's self
10. Improves decision making (Goucher College Office of Student Engagement, n.d.)

Students benefit greatly when they get to determine what is goal worthy and what is simply a task that they must do. Being able to organize, prioritize, and plan their work builds academic agency as well, and as classroom educators and school leaders, we must endeavor to teach ALL learners in our schools.
