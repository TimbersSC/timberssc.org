Being able to see, know, amplify, and lift all students is the equity challenge of this generation of teachers. Too often, negative scripts get internalized by students and teachers alike. These scripts seem to say that there are students whose abilities or positions afford them the best opportunities, while others will not find that same level of achievement.

*Ferant Teachers* look to disrupt that narrative.

The act of empowering students means drawing out their lived experiences and personal strengths every day.

But this can be a challenge to do, especially at scale, when a teacher has 150 students streaming through the walls of their classroom every day. As a result, the Ferant dashboard gives the teacher the leverage to do this well. 

Students and teachers who visit our application are able to take a personalized profiler that allows them to see their assets in a colorful display. Each student receives three asset roles plus a lifeword. The asset roles have been formulated with analytical power to allow each student to apply them to the tasks that they face. 

Ferant also stands with enlightened practitioners in the field of positive psychology, such as Martin Seligman at UPenn, whose [Happiness Project](https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/) affirms the value of focusing on what's right with a person instead of focusing on deficits.

The problem for any practitioner of asset-based practice is that we are hard wired for survival to avoid weakness. We focus on deficits because we think, on some level, that this will help us survive. However, our survival in a complex, post-modern society relies on making a contribution--economically, personally, artistically, relationally--to our worlds, so focusing on assets will yield much greater success.
