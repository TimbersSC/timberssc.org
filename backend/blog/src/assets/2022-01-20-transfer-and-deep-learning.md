But if we know that asset-based teaching and coaching is highly correlated with both academic achievement and wellbeing, the question is how to do it well? This post presents a useful questioning strategy in four parts.'

We know that strength-based coaching is effective in helping learners of all ages–young people especially. In particular, strengths coaching helps students find *greater academic achievement and greater wellbeing*. That is just fantastic! And the power of this practice is right at our fingertips as asset-based educators.

But what is not known as clearly is the best way to activate these conversations. They are artful in many ways. Students may only be vaguely aware of their strengths, so the need might be first to know what the strengths are. In these cases, dialogue might focus on defining the strength. What does it mean to be a person of *Conscience*? What does a *Networker* do? If you are an *Adventurer*, how is that different from a *Director*? 

Does it matter? 

In this article, we will present a four-part questioning strategy to help learners to explore these assets and more through thoughtful, dialogic exchanges. As a result, they can reach up and see possibilities for learning that will inspire them.

At Ferant, our school-based dashboard and classroom approach that empowers learners in middle and high school, has a [rich array of assets](https://sites.google.com/view/the-ferant-teacher2/asset-roles-reference) that students can identify with through our profiler. Schools can elect to have whole classes or whole campuses take the profiler, as well! In this way, the community of learners becomes empowered–a *Ferant School* community.

Drawing on a questioning strategy called [Depth of Knowledge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xnDzxXy9s-ilxVPByhoo7Zq30A8Rk6VMYHfYmQ_RdnY/edit), Asset-Based Coaching uses four levels of questioning to guide an interactive conversation that centers the learner's thinking, feelings, and experiences.

## Level 1: Define the Strength
This first level focuses on the basics of what is. As you can tell, the important move here is for instructors to let the learner do the talking. It's worth it for you to put resources in front of them and ask a question or two and elicit thinking. Via 
Through the app, the learner will have a set definition on their home screen that you can read together. What do the words mean? What needs to be clarified? 

## Level 2: Personalize
The next level of understanding comes to making sure that you center the student's background not the asset itself. This might sound counter-intuitive, but nobody--especially younger learners!--wants to be labeled by someone else. This kills a person's sense of autonomy. Instead, the learner (and this can be a colleague or even your boss!) should look at the set of assets that have been identified by the profiler and ask: [Which of these assets applies to you?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o9hm0SogQd5uXLzyXW1UO74fmF8xc9RT/view?usp=sharing) Which do you identify with the most? [As a younger person or as a kid](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nD6RuwPYhauH0NqVmvYdMcx-Il9Mp24g/view?usp=sharing), did you ever make friends easily (*Networker*) or did you find yourself thinking about right and wrong a lot? (*Conscience*). It's ok if the learner does not identify with the Asset Role. They have three to choose from, and they might rank them in order. But the important thing, however, is for the coach to allow the learner to choose. The freedom to positively frame one's identity is such a beautiful and amazing thing! As an asset-based coach you provide the learner an open space that is free from judgment and the negative labels that are so prevalent in our society. Think of what a gift this might be for a young person! For a young person of color, who may have internalized deficit labels and messages over the years. 

## Level 3: Apply
This is the most critical stage of strengths coaching because it moves from *What* and *How to What if*. Learners probably have a pretty strong idea of what the Asset Role is supposed to mean by now and maybe even the level to which the asset has shown up in their lives. That is, they might know *What* the asset is and *How* it has shown up. But now an Asset-Based Coach (i.e. classroom teacher) will guide the learner to stretch the Asset Role to new situations. This is critical, out-of-box thinking. It's also more cognitively complex. Further it's devalued and under practiced in schools. 

However, it's exciting to ask students how they can apply the Asset Role in a given class or in the future in a given career or life situation. For example, in one class setting, a learner with the Asset Role of being a Mechanic was asked to apply the skills and insights that are native to him to the study of History, as it it was a U.S. History class. It was so powerful to literally see the lightbulb flash brightly above the student's head and hear him say, "Of course you need to take things apart to understand them better! That's what I do as a Mechanic. It's also what we have to do when we learn about all of these wars in History class. What caused them, who was involved." Another student said that she, as a person with the Asset Role of Conscience, thinks very deeply about people and their motivations. When asked if she ever did this as a kid (Level 2), she said, "YES! All of the time!" She went on to describe the quiet moments that she would spend by herself, considering the people in her life. But she had never thought it was a strength of any kind. 

So then she was asked, What about in this class, do you think that you can use that strength in here? She said, immediately, "Yes! This is a literature class, and we are always talking about short stories with characters and trying to figure out what they think and why they do things." It was such a powerful and mind-blowing moment! Here was a learner who had never had her personal strength used in school explicitly. When asked, she said that mostly her teachers saw her previously as a Quiet Kid. Her inner strength as a person of *Conscience*, such an incredible intellectual and moral personal asset structure, was untapped, unseen, underappreciated. 

The point of this section is that Coaches need to be aware that the leap from Level 2 to Level 3 is quantum, and it will take practice. The examples here were remarkably easy to elicit. The students were comfortable and ready to share. It did not make a difference that they were in an alternative school setting and that they had chalked up many grades of F along the way. Now they were ready to Reframe themselves and their learning because a caring and insightful practitioner was enabling them to take the risk to reframe their self concept from deficit to asset, from passive to active, from not-used to useful.

It would be worthwhile to consider giving learners explicit practice in thinking divergently about their assets. This process requires deeper learning as it focuses on transfer (NRC, 2012), which will allow them to internalize the strength and have it become truly theirs. In this way, an extrinsic label or defined Asset Role becomes part of their psychological capital. It becomes generative too, as the learner can then create new understandings as they see fit. 

## Level 4: Explore Community via Complementarity and Acceptance
The next level of application moves from the individual and their contexts to the class or school as a whole. Middle- and high-school students are in the Identity vs. Role Confusion stages of their lives, but the next conflict that they will face, according to famous psychologist, Erick Erickson, is Intimacy vs. Isolation. Will they be able to create space for another person and truly trust that person? And at this cultural moment, many young people are feeling isolated and in need of being understood. Young people want community. Adults do as well, and understanding one's value to the culture of work is central to the feelings of belonging that make work dignifying and meaningful. 

Thus, in this stage of asset coaching, focus on complementarity and acceptance. As students to consider asset roles in context. Ask: in your small group, what is the top Asset Role (the one you identify with the most) for each person? How do these roles build upon one another? What gaps do you have as an individual that get filled when you work as a group? What are your super strengths as a group? How might these insights affect the ways in which you respond to the work that you need to do? 

Or acceptance. When working in a pair--or being in a relationship or being married or getting along with your best friends--what do you do when the other person has strengths that are drastically different from yours? How can you make space for that person? What would that relationship be like if you each tried to Coach each other to be the best version of yourselves? At the very least, how can we refrain from judging people whose Asset Roles are different from ours? We don't need to be like them or have them be like us: different is better.
